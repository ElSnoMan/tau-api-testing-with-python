# API Testing with Python, by Carlos Kidman

In this Test Automation University course, we cover how to consume an API for automation and automated testing using:

- python
- pytest
- requests
- pydantic

## Prerequisites

I will be using **VS Code** as my IDE, but you are welcome to use any IDE you want, like **PyCharm**.

> ðŸ’¡ If you want to follow along exactly with Carlos's setup, then [watch this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=547Jr26duHQ) to set up your machine for Python Development

Otherwise, you need to have:

- python installed on your machine (version `^3.7`)
- understanding of how to use Virtual Environments and install packages
- basic programming fundamentals (variables, functions, etc.)

## Setup

1. Clone the Project (switch to `setup` branch for beginning in **Chapter 4**)

2. Create a virtual environment for this project

   - If you are following along with Carlos's setup and using Poetry, this is already handled for you - skip this step

3. Install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# or

poetry install
```

You're all set!
